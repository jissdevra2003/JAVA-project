The Designation and Employee Management System is a robust software application developed in Java that allows organizations to efficiently manage employee records and designations. This system provides a user-friendly interface for performing CRUD operations on both employee and designation data stored in a database. The system is designed to streamline HR processes, ensuring that employee information is always up-to-date and easily accessible.
The Designation and Employee Management System is developed using a layered programming architecture in Java.
1)Presentation Layer (UI Layer):This layer is responsible for interacting with the users. It presents the data and captures user input.
The GUI of the designation system is developed using swing in JAVA.
Sends user inputs to the business layer for processing.
2)Business Layer:The BL provides the core business logic and processes user input from the presentation layer. 
Processes requests from the presentation layer, such as adding or updating employee and designation records.
Communicates with the data layer to perform database operations.
Handles exceptions and errors, ensuring that the system remains stable.
3)Data Layer:The layer does the processing of the data accepted from the user as input and stores the data in the database.
For database storage the JDBC (Java database connectivity) is used to connect and communicate with the RDBMS.
For RDBMS MySql database is used for the storage and retrieval of designation and employee data. 
The database operations are also done using file handling in JAVA.
